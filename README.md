# css_x-ray_animation
Animation that simulates an x-ray of two overlaid gif's or videos.

This allows you to place two videos on top of one another and see "through" the first to view the second video.

Please note I do not own the video/artwork, it belongs to https://stevelew.is/ if you steal it he will sue you probably..
